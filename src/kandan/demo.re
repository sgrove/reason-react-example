  "It won't respect our return value. (Actually - fiber will IIRC, but classic React won't)",
  "(We could/should fix that)",
  "it does give you the newest bag though",
  "<mention!> I guess you also discussed with sebastian on what the return of updater should be? Fiber's setState \"rebasing\" would break our current updater return logic(edited)",
  "I recall we're more compatible with Fiber, and less compatible with stack.",
  "Do you have a particular conversation you're recalling?",
  "<mention!> ^",
  "so the conversation we were talking about is about where handleClick happens in fiber:\n\nlet handleClick {state} => {\n  logSomeEvent \"click\";\n  Some {...state, clicks: state.clicks + 1}\n};\n\nlet render {state} => <div onClick=(updater handleClick)> (state.clicks) </div>;\n\n\nRight now, it happens in the event callback as expected, but that means that the return value is based on possibly stale state.\n\nIn order to make this handle correcly, you actually want it in the \"reducer callback\" version of setstate so it has access to fresh props/state. but then updater cbs need to (should) be pure functions. in fiber they may need to call setstate more than once if different priority work shifts the queue. this means that if moved, that log side effect would potentially get called more than once.",
  "sebastian was advocating for updater callbacks to be pure by convention and to return a tuple of state and a side effectual callback to be made later (or some variant that allows for both of those to be returned). one issue there is that event-specific side effects like preventdefault become impossible because the function doesnt get run until the event has already propogated.",
  "\"sebastian was advocating for updater callbacks to be pure by convention and to return a tuple of state and a side effectual callback to be made later (\"\nAbsolutely. I would do this even if Fiber didn't exist.",
  "<mention!> I think the problem is that I pass updater to a event listener on the document, outside of React's world. Does that updater fn have access to the latest state later on when the event happens, even if lots of other events have happened in the interim?",
  "But the reason we can't use the callback version of setState, is only because React itself doesn't provide us a way to say \"Oh actually I don't want to set any state\" in the callback version. I tried to use it and found that React doesn't respect it. We are very much in alignment with the callback version - React just has one issue there.(edited)",

  "Hrm...",
  "I believe returning null or undefined says \"oh actually i don't want to set any state\"",
  "<mention!> It doesn't - only in Fiber.",
  "They might have backported that feature to Stack version of React.",
  "ahhh. do we need to work well with stack?",
  "Yes, I think so.",
  "or we should get this feature backported.",
  "the tuple return type is awkward, but manageable.",
  "<mention!> We can make a custom return type.",
  "Instead of None/Some",
  "| NoUpdate\n| UpdateState 's\n| UpdateStateAndMutate 's (list (unit => unit))\n(edited)",

  "yeah yeah ^^ that ",
  "<mention!> I recall we needed to go with the callback approach to avoid hacking the impl bc of staleness?",
  "side effect functions probably need to be passed up-to-date componentBag, not just unit.",
  "yeah. so many opportunities to read stale state.",
  "<mention!> setState has the same problem.",
  "<mention!> really? It's a callback that reads the newest state?",
  "I'm certain this is an opportunity for us to provide a Fiber-centric API that plays well with the language and culture of immutability.",

  "<mention!> We should just really get this backported ASAP, because we want to change the bindings so that everything is using the callback form by default. I would hate to update the bindings, and then have a bunch of stuff break that was relying on subtle event ordering or stale state.",
  "<mention!> My bad, it's too late for me to be coding, I was still calling updater",
  "<mention!> Ah, I think it's that I closed over some state somewhere. Works now, but wonder if I can get away without setState. Will look at it tomorrow.",
  "lol i was curious so i thought id try and poke around the react codebase to see if i could find where Stack is handling the cb setState. #dogscience all night long. Lots of stuff going on in there.",
  "<mention!> now you know the pain lol",
  "<mention!> I think it's actually a really easy fix.",
  "It would be a check if if return value === null || return value === undefined, then do nothing.",

  "<mention!> I'm trying to subscribe to https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowEventHandlers/onhashchange - just a manual external to access the oldUrl newUrl fields?",
  "<mention!> My plan is to finish writing this demo app with all of the features I can think of, see what requires externals once it's finished, and then merge that upstream.",

  "Jai has that I think. This way you can maybe enforce that \"this thing you're passing me shouldn't read into the closure\"",
  "it's also a tool-less, language-level way of easily refactoring code. Just lift it out through copy pasting. No closure retained",
  "you can \"trivially\" build this with a ppx plugin no?",
  "You annotate functions as [@doYouEvenLift], and then it will ensure that it actually can be lifted ahead of time.",
  "right now in ocamlc/ocamlopt, functions that don't utilize free variables, are reliably lifted ahead of time to the data section of the binary - allocated once IIRC.",
  "and likely easily optimized away, so you'd use a new pattern where you write a huge function but have multiple combinators inside for code organization, instead of introducing another indirection for readers to go search for the function callsite",
  "ah, nice",
  "well then, a reason syntax for combinator",
  "yeah, functions are great ways to abstract things - apart from their ability to capture the closure.",
  "hell yeah",
  "and then we can ensure statically that some setState callback or something else are reading into closures",
  "reason syntax: func foo a b => ...",
  "for \"fun combinator\"",
  "If we add unicode support, we can use some kind of annotation like:\n\n\nlet  myFunctionToLift x y => x + y;\n\nGet it, lift?(edited)",
  "List.map is a great example of where this is super useful.",
  "humm",
  "ok another idea: discourage bad patterns through emojis that are hard to type",
  "(The callback you pass to it, I mean)",
  "let foo =  5",
  "that's a ref",
  "but millennials will just use those bad patterns more then.",
  "ok ANOTHER IDEA: encourage good pattern through emojis or unicode:",
  "haha, Before you use Reason - Please enter your age range: [ ] followed by the enter key",
  "let foo = {...bar, baz: 1}",
  "notice it's a tasteful unicode ellipsis",
  "I actually want that one",
  "(Ascii too not unicode IIRC) (edit: I'm right - it's extended ASCII)(edited)",
  "Vim's conceal can easily do this one though.",
